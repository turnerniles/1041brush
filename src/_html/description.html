      A rare find. Beautiful private and secluded (approved)
      building lot for a new single family home. This property is accessed from a
      communal driveway and sits approx. 800 ft from the actual road-one of the most
      beautiful and private lots surrounded by majestic trees. Only minutes from Milton
      public school, Milton Academy, and the intersection of RT 128/93 and
      Interstate95.

        This property has become available due to a recent subdivision. The property has
        an existing Carriage House built in 1939 per town records which is zoned as a
        “care takers property” for a new home. The carriage house of 952 sq ft. has an
        attractive hard wood floor 2-bedroom, 1 bath apartment on the second floor
        which includes a handicap elevator. From a deck you can see the Blue Hills. On
        the ground floor there is 2 room/1 bath, heated office space, with carpeted floors,
        as well as the main barn with cement floor with parking for 3 cars, a work bench,
        storage space and the ramp for the elevator. Additional storage for bikes, yard
        equipment, boats, etc. is accessed under the home from the back of the building.

      Please note that this carriage house, as previously mentioned, is zoned as a
      “caretakers residence” for the new home to be built on this lot. The existing
      structure would be non-conforming as a single family residence, and a variance
      would be needed for use in this fashion. The property is NOT being sold with this
      intention. The existing structure can remain as a care takers residence and garage,
      or it can be torn down.
